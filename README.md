# Project Overview:

The project involves building an API for managing posts, including CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
Authentication and authorization are implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access to certain routes.

## Key Components:

### Authentication and Authorization:

- JWT tokens are used for authentication and authorization.
- A secret key, algorithm, and expiration time for tokens are configured.
- OAuth2 password bearer scheme is defined for token-based authentication.

### Token Handling Functions:

- `create_access_token`: Generates a JWT access token with an expiration time.
- `verify_access_token`: Verifies the JWT access token and extracts user data.
- `get_current_user`: Retrieves the current user based on the provided JWT token.

### Database Interaction:

- User data is stored in a database, and SQLAlchemy is used for interacting with it.
- User model (`models.User`) is defined for managing user-related data.

### Integration with FastAPI Routes:

- FastAPI routes are defined for managing posts.
- Routes require authentication, and access is restricted based on the user's token.
- CRUD operations for posts (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are implemented.

## Overall:

The project aims to provide a secure API for managing posts, with authentication and authorization mechanisms in place to control access to sensitive endpoints.
